    Fluroinated gases are various Fluor-containing molecules (SF<sub>6</sub>, NF<sub>3</sub>, PFC, HFC) that are found in different industry and product sectors. <br>
    <br> 
    Main driver of emissions today are the use of Hydroflurocarbons (HFCs) as cooling agents in refrigerators and stationary air conditionings (ACs), which have been widely used since 1993 to replace the ozone depleting Chlorofluorocarbon (HCFCs). Their use is now however restricted in the EU and emissions have started to decline. <br> 
    <br> 
    Other emissions stem from mobile ACs (cars), which are also starting to decline due to EU restrictions, and emissions from various smaller sectors ("Other") such as foam blowing agents or the insulation of particle accelerators and other high voltage electrical equipment (SF6).
