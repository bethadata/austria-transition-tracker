  Waste sector greenhouse gas emissions have historically been mostly related to CH<sub>4</sub> emissions of biological waste in landfills. Due to stricter legislation and policy measures the amount of untreated waste in landfills has however declined in the last years. <br> 
  <br> 
  Today, most GHG emissions stem from the incineration of waste in power plants to produce electricity and heat. Net CO<sub>2</sub> emissions here result from non-biogenic waste (e.g., plastics, industrial waste). <br> 
  <br> 
  Smaller fractions stem from CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from biological waste treatment ("composting") and waste water treatment (sewage treatment plants).
