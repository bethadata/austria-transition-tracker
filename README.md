# AUSTRIA TRANSITION TRACKER

Welcome to the Austria energy and sustainability transition tracker. 
This pages collects available data from various sources and tries to update them regularly to provide a comprehensive overview over the energy transition and related topics in Austria. 

## Directories 
Under "data" you can find all python scripts to download and plot all charts. Note that some data sets (e.g., Statistics Austria) are updated manually. The "data/plot" diretory contains all chart-generating scripts, including pre-processing scripts ("utils") for data filtering. The "data/source" directory contains automatic downloading scripts for all eurostat-relevant data. <br>
Under "docs" you find all html/css/md files relevant for the homepage. 

## Setting up the site locally 
To run the site on a localhost, install <a href = "https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/">Jekyll and Bundler via Ruby </a>. If Jekyll has been installed, run "bundle exec jekyll serve" in the "docs" directory. You should then be able to navigate to the site via "localhost:3000" in any browser.
